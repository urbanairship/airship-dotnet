### Known Issues
Build/run via a linked Mac from Visual Studio on Windows is not currently working as expected. This appears to be a known issue and is expected to be fixed in the upcoming .NET 8 release. In our testing, this issue impacts other SDKs that make use of XCFrameworks, and is not limited to Airship SDKs. We will continue monitoring the situation and update with any new workarounds or fixes that become available.

Builds and runs performed directly on a Mac are not impacted by this issue.
